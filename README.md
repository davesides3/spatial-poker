Thank you to Frank Force for [ZzFX](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX/), a tiny sound generator.

Inspired by ASCII text Star Trek games from long ago and the broad shoulders of the modern browsers, including unicode playing cards.

Key Learnings
- power of grid
- with only 13K, leverage the browser environment (e.g. unicode cards)
- so much more to learn about CSS!
- so much more to learn about JavaScript!
- basic programming remains the same as decades ago, but Google, StackOverflow, etc. amazing
- tight REPL is essential for productivity and fun! (check out https:/www.glitch.com)
- keep it simple - polishing even a simple game takes a lot of time

Would Be Nice - easier
- Enter on index.html submits form (out of time - had to move on)
- ace on bottom straight
- as soon as opponent has full house, chase player
- undo last key
- choose board size (don't deal all 52 cards)

Would Be Nice - more difficult
- multi-level grids (ala 3D Chess)
- jokers
- more than 5 card hand
- choose number of opponents
- multi-player

Mobile
- add touch
- add drag-and-drop to reorder hand
- keep hand visible on screen regardless of sizing?
